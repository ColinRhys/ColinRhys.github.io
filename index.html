              <p><a target="_blank" href="http://multicoincalc.com/">MultiCoinCalc</a> is a project I worked on with a classmate at the Coding Dojo. We both had an interest in crypto currencies and so decided that making an improved version of an existing website that only featured dollar to Bitcoin and a few other crypto currencies. Finding a good API for this project was a major first step. The API we found featured the US dollar and other fiat based currencies which was already more than the other website. Additionally, we found the API offered conversion information on a large number of crypto currencies. We choose to offer conversion for the five major fiat currencies to the top 100 crypto currencies.</p>
              <br>
              <p>A major challenge associated with this project was making an auto complete feature for the "Coin Name", so that a user can enter either the ticker for the coin name or the full coin name. The API call needed the coin ticker and not the full coin name so we had to make a list of all of the coin names with the ticker symbols. With the list we were able to implement an auto complete feature so that if the user only knew the name of the coin the website can start to show a drop down menu with the guesses for the name of the coin which will be entered as the ticker for the coin when clicked on and make the correct API call returning accurate price information on the conversion.</p>

              <p>Before I began at the Coding Dojo I had heard of Raspberry Pi's and thought they were super cool. I initially wanted to make an old-fashioned scrolling stock ticker with LED lights. Once I started researching the project I found that it would be cheaper to buy the official touch screen made by the Raspberry Pi foundation. I wanted to reformat the display to be more of an information dashboard rather than a mirror. This presented a bit of a challenge because the default formatting was not a dashboard like setting. I overcame this challenge by creating my own CSS class that used the full screen. With this new class in place I was able to fit the scrolling stock ticker that I originally wanted and a lot of other cool modules on my display. All of the modules use their own APIs for the data that is being fed into and displayed on the screen.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The module for the stock ticker at the bottom of the screen initially showed the 0's of unchanged stocks as red. I thought it would be better to have them be grey a neutral color and different than the white of the stock ticker symbols. I added an âif checkâ for the stock change being zero and created a new CSS class for unchanged stocks that makes the 0 grey. After changing the code and making sure it worked I opened a pull request on gitHub so everyone else could have grey zeros too.</p>

              <p>An app I made that allows users to swipe through quotes and swipe a quote left to skip over it or right to save it to their âSaved Quotesâ. The app features a free account and a premium account. With the free account a user can swipe through 15 quotes every 12 hours and save up to 25 quotes in their âSaved Quotesâ at which point they are prompted to purchase a premium account. The premium account is an auto renewable subscription that allows users to both swipe through and save an unlimited number of quotes. All of the payments are processed through SwiftyStoreKit. There is also a website that I made for the app which is just a landing page. Take a look by clicking on the website <a target="_blank" href="http://www.swipeaquote.com/">www.swipeaquote.com</a></p>

          <p>Apart from finance and developing software , I enjoy reading. I read the Economist every week and always look forward to Saturdays, knowing I can wake up go to the gym, then come back and read the hard copy of the Economist with some coffee.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">In addition to the Economist I generally have more than one book going at a time.  I bounce between them; if I  find myself getting tired of one I go to another and then come back to the one I started, and so forth.. I enjoy nonfiction, especially biographies.</p>
          <br>
          <p>After receiving my degree in Economics from the University of Tampa I chose to move to Chicago -- a great city with a larger financial job market. I have not regretted it one bit! One of my favorite things about Chicago is the great selection of live Jazz music.</p>
